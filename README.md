# User Experience UX
- ## User Stories
- ### <u>First Time Visitor Goals</u>
* As a first time visitor I want to understand the site and its purpose clearly.
* I want to navigate the site with ease and have clearly defined paths to each page and a clear direction back to the home page.

- ### <u>Returning Visitor Goals</u>
* As a returning visitor I want to see any updates to the site noted clearly.
* I also want to find the social media links in a convenient location which will open in a new tab once I navigate to it.
* The sign up process to join the club must be user friendly and simple to access and complete.

- ### <u>Frequent User Goals</u>
* As a frequent user I want to see any club updates or changes noted at monthly screenings updated in a clear fashion.
* I want to see the gallery page updated with the previous screenings cinema posters.

# Design
- ### <u>Colour Scheme</u> 
* the two main colours used are #2F4F4F and #357367 (Dark Slate Grey and a lighter variant).

- ### <u>Typography</u> 
* The simple and reliable sans-serif is used throughout the site.

- ### <u>Imagery</u>
* All movie lovers share a deep appreciation for the art of a movie poster. A movie poster can illicit an emotional response. Therefore the imagery used is designed to encapsulate the atmosphere of a cinema. On the home page the user is greeted with a common picture of a cinema with an audience in attendance. The user will then move into the previous showings page in which they will find the original cinema poster art for the previous screenings. Or one could imagine leaving the cinema through a corridor lined with cinema posters. The final image is a play on the well known phrasing from the Evil Dead movies in which the main character, Ash Williams, is constantly beckoned by the 'Deadite Horde' to "JOIN US". The image used is the Cabin in which most of the first and second movies are set.
* Form submit button developed as 'groovy' is a movie buff's in-joke on the famous Ash Williams catchphrase from the Evil Dead movies.
