- ### <u>Colour Scheme</u> 
* the two main colours used are #2F4F4F and #357367 (Dark Slate Grey and a lighter variant)

- ### <u>Typography</u> 
* The simple and reliable sans-serif is used throughout the site

- ### <u>Imagery</u>
* All movie lovers share a deep appreciation for the art of a movie poster. A movie poster can illicit an emotional response. Therefor the imagery used is designed to encapsulate the atmosphere of a cinema. On the home page the user is greeted with a common picture of a cinema with an audience in attendance. The user will then move into the previous showings page in which they will find the original cinema poster art for the previous screenings. Or one could imagine leaving the cinema through a corridor lined with cinema posters. The final image is a play on the well known phrasing from the Evil Dead movies in which the main character, Ash Williams, is constantly beckoned by the 'Deadite Horde' to "JOIN US". The image used is the Cabin in which most of the first and second movies are set.
